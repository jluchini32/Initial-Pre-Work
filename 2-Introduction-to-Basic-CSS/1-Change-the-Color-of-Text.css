The thing I took away most from this section, was the variable naming convention used in CSS. I hadnt really used 
the :root selector before this course. I had a solid understanding of most coloring, sizing, and naming rules within CSS before this,
but I could definitly improve upon keeping my css clean, going back to check if Im already styling an element,
before I try to create a new class or id to overwrite it. I think that that section did a good job of explaining how to 
prioritize items styling, but in the future I will try to avoid doing that as to not create confusion. I really enjoy using
CSS, so this was a nice refresher on some of the things I wasnt utilizing before. I would say that my CSS skills are a bit
more advanced than what this section covers, but I will try to mix in more of these techniques, so that my work 
never gets stale.
