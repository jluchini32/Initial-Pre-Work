In this lesson, I had a nice review of html and some of its capabilities. It is never a bad 
thing to revisit basics and see some of those elements and tricks that might have went over my head before.
I didnt know about radio buttons before this lesson, and I believe that I've only used "checkboxes" 
only once before. I also liked that you could use "checked" to indicate a pre-made choice. This 
would come in handy when your form may be sent to a database, so that there are no empty fields, 
it would be up to the user to correct the radio or checkbox. Overall, I have a really good understanding
of how HTML looks and works. I look forward to using CSS to start styling.
