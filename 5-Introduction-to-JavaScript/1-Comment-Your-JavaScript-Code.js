//This javascript section had tons of ups and downs! There were times that I was flying through questions
// ,and there were times that I felt like I didn’t know anything! Luckily, there were a ton of resources to 
//refer to when I got stuck. I enjoyed this section because although it was a challenge, I think having a 
//refresher on javascript basics was exactly what I needed for my programming skills. I’ve tried my hand at
// a lot of different languages, libraries, and frameworks, and it all comes back to Javascript. 
//Learning and applying vanilla Javascript in your work, (in my opinion) says a lot about your understanding
// of coding in general. Learning other languages, the syntax and structure may change, but the logic and thoughts
// behind it is all the same. My biggest takeaway from this entire section, is that javascript is one of the most 
//important skills to hone to be a successful programmer!

//Covering fundamental concepts such as accessing data inside arrays, and objects was one of the most
// important lessons in my opinion, there are so many times in programming, that you know WHAT you have 
//to get out of your array or object, but knowing HOW is a different story. Using bracket and dot notation
// to access data is a sure-fire way to get what you need, but is not great for scalability. I decided to dig
// a little deeper in the area of accessing, updating and deleting object properties, and what came out of It
// was also very helpful, especially when I got into a refresher on the built in js functions such as push(),
// pop(), shift(), & unshift() which sent me down a rabbit hole of researching and learning about other built-in
// functions.. trying to understand .map .filter & .reduce is another beast in itself. Having a deep dive on global
//and local scope and precedence of variables was also helpful in tackling some of the function challenges. 
//One thing that I really struggled with was using the global (var) while writing my functions. I tried to
// stick to the rules to pass the tests. But I think there were quite a few times that I was using const and let
// out of habit. The more I got reacquainted with ES6 in the lesson following this one, the more I felt confident 
//in my js skills. People must have been having some of the same thoughts I first had when I was learning ES5: “There
// HAS to be a better way”. Luckily, only about 4 or 5 times did I really get hit with a brain-buster that left me
// second-guessing if I’ve learned anything at all over the past few months. All-in-all a great review of some really
//important information.
